- Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm for binary classification

#### Types
-Binary: Two classes (e.g., Spam/Not Spam). 
- Multinomial: >2 unordered classes (e.g., Cat/Dog/Bird). 
- Ordinal: Ordered classes (e.g., Low/Medium/High).



#### Advantages:
- Simple and interpretable (coefficients indicate feature importance)
- Provides probabilistic outputs
- Efficient to train and implement
- Works well with small datasets
